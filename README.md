# PSY300: R Resources
Natalia Vélez & Justin Jungé, Fall 2024

This semester, we'll do our coursework in R, a programming language for statistics and data visualization. Compared to all-purpose languages---such as Python---R is a specialized tool: It has lots of tools to help you see the world through data. In this repository, we've put together useful resources to help you learn R from scratch, and some fun R projects to inspire your work work. 

And, as always, remember: 
* Be lazy
* Work on projects that make you happy
* Don't be afraid to Google

The [r/RStudio](https://reddit.com/r/rstudio) and [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) communities are a great place to start---here are some of our favorite projects!

* [Plotting nail polish](https://conleykinkead.github.io/nail-polish/visualization_final_report.html) by Conley Kinkead: Cataloguing and visualizing a nail polish collection
* [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): Weekly social data analysis challenges - take a look at past weeks and find datasets that you're curious about! We're particularly fond of [The Great American Coffee Taste Test](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-05-14/readme.md),[a massive dataset of cat movement tracking data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-01-31/readme.md), and [The Great Tidy Plot Off](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-10-25).
