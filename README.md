# PSY300: R Resources
Natalia V√©lez & Justin Jung√©, Fall 2024

This semester, we'll do our coursework in R, a programming language for statistics and data visualization. Compared to all-purpose languages‚Äîsuch as Python‚ÄîR is a specialized tool: It has lots of tools to help you see the world through data. In this repository, we've put together useful resources to help you learn R from scratch, and some fun R projects to inspire your work work. 

And, as always, remember: 
* Be lazy
* Work on projects that make you happy
* Don't be afraid to Google

## Learning R

### Roadmap 

In general, the basic skills you'll need to analyze a dataset in R are:

* Loading, peeking at, and wrangling data
* Visualizing your data with plots
* Running statistical analyses

In the resources below, we'll link you to some of our favorite resources to develop these skills, based on your current comfort level with programming. (Note: The beginner resources should be more than enough to get you through the class‚Äîpeek through the advanced ones for your own curiosity and learning!)

### Beginner

**Data wrangling:** 

**Visualization:**
* [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/): A free online textbook with a _massive_ gallery of examples. Start here!
* [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/): A massive gallery of plots made with ggplot, with code. Scroll through this and see if there's a plot that you can adapt to your needs. 
* [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co/) by Kieran Healy: While the graphics cookbook and gallery will show you _how_ to make good plots, this book is a great guide on what data visualization is _for_, and why some plots are more effective than others. You can also get a crash course on general principles of good data visualization in [Chapter 15 of Experimentology](https://experimentology.io/015-viz.html).
* [Data visualization with ggplot2: Cheat sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html): Prof. V√©lez spent a lot of time staring at this PDF when she learned R in grad school!

**Statistics:** 

### Advanced

**Data wrangling:** 

**Visualization:**
* One of the great joys of R is messing around with themes and color schemes to make your plots pretty. Here are some of our favorite resources:
   * [ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes): Better themes for ggplot
   * [MetBrewer](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer): Color schemes inspired by pieces from the Met Gallery
   * [peRReo](https://github.com/jbgb13/peRReo): R color schemes inspired by reggaeton albums (üáµüá∑‚ù§Ô∏è - Prof. V√©lez)

**Statistics:** 

## R inspo
The [r/RStudio](https://reddit.com/r/rstudio) and [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) communities are a great place to start. Here are some of our favorite projects!

* [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): Weekly social data analysis challenges - take a look at past weeks and find datasets that you're curious about! We're particularly fond of [The Great American Coffee Taste Test](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-05-14/readme.md),[a massive dataset of cat movement tracking data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-01-31/readme.md), and [The Great Tidy Plot Off](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-10-25).
* [Plotting nail polish](https://conleykinkead.github.io/nail-polish/visualization_final_report.html) by Conley Kinkead: Cataloguing and visualizing a nail polish collection
* Predicting the [winner](https://imgur.com/a/gbbo-analysis-prediction-liS0X0q) and [ratings](https://alison.netlify.app/uo-tidy-bakeoff/) for the Great British Bakeoff (warning: contains some Series 8 spoilers!)
