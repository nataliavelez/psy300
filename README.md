# PSY300: R Resources
Natalia Vélez & Justin Jungé, Fall 2024

This semester, we'll do our coursework in R, a programming language for statistics and data visualization. Compared to all-purpose languages---such as Python---R is a specialized tool: It has lots of tools to help you see the world through data. In this repository, we've put together useful resources to help you learn R from scratch, and some fun R projects to inspire your work work. 

And, as always, remember: 
* Be lazy
* Work on projects that make you happy
* Don't be afraid to Google
